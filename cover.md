## Dear Prezi Recruitment Team,

In the age of AI-powered applications, transparency is key: this cover letter was written with the help of generative AI tools. Crafting thoughtful prompts, selecting the best outcomes, and refining the final result mirrors the skills required of the next generation of engineers. As with much of my code—enhanced by IDEs and AI—I believe the future of work is a collaboration between humans and machines. I am excited to embrace this future and contribute to Prezi's mission to revolutionize visual storytelling.

With over a decade of experience in web development, I bring a strong product mindset, a structured approach, and a passion for building applications that resonate with users. My expertise includes TypeScript on both frontend and backend, Python for prototyping AI solutions, and reactive frameworks like React and Vue.js. In addition, I’ve worked with generative AI models and prompt engineering, directly aligning with the innovative work of Prezi’s Content Team.

A recent project involved collaborating with cross-functional teams to develop an internal AI-powered tool that is aimed at reducing friction in a particular domain of our application in order to improve customer use of the tool. This experience taught me the power of combining cutting-edge technology with intuitive design to deliver real impact.

What excites me most about Prezi is its commitment to fostering a team that deeply cares about innovation and the people behind it. Being part of an organization that celebrates creativity and collaboration would allow me to continue pushing boundaries while learning from others who share this vision.

I would love the opportunity to bring my technical expertise and product-focused mindset to Prezi, helping users create visual presentations they’re proud of. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.

Warm regards,

James Martin
