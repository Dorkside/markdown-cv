**Hiring Manager**  
GitLab

Dear Hiring Manager,

I discovered the Frontend Engineer role at GitLab on VueJobs, and it immediately sparked my interest, harmonizing with my journey as a creative product engineer passionate about AI and Vue.js. My website, [james-martin.dev](https://james-martin.dev), paints a vivid picture of my professional ethos - a blend of innovative solution-finding and a vibrant, diverse background.

Currently crafting generative AI front-ends at AXA, I resonate deeply with GitLab's culture of rapid iteration and meaningful collaboration. My hands-on experience in leading AI projects, coupled with a penchant for thinking outside the box, nurtured in a life straddling diverse cultures, aligns perfectly with the ethos of GitLab.

At GitLab, I see an opportunity not just to expand my technical horizons but to contribute to a platform that values agility, creativity, and open idea sharing - principles that I live by. My personal and professional life is a testament to embracing change and diversity - attributes I am excited to bring to the GitLab team.

Thank you for considering my application.  
The prospect of contributing to GitLab's innovative environment excites me, and I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to your team. I am keen to discuss how my professional journey aligns with GitLab's dynamic projects, and how I can contribute to driving them forward. This role is not just a career move for me, but a chance to inspire my family, especially my son, with the meaningful work GitLab is known for. I look forward to the possibility of connecting with you to explore this opportunity further.

Warm regards,

James Martin
