## Experiences

`July 2021 - Today`
__Tech lead__, AXA

_After a fruitful partnership as an external collaborator, it was decided to bring me on board as a permanent team member to continue contributing to the software development efforts._

• The project had a proof-of-concept (PoC) that needed to be industrialized and prepared for deployment.
My task was to manage the industrialization of the PoC, which involved coordinating the team, designing the architecture, communicating with clients, and documenting the project.
To achieve this, I set up a CI/CD process and a continuous deployment system, and implemented a monitoring system to ensure the quality and stability of the system. I also modified the code to switch from a heavy client to a light client, which involved redesigning the architecture and updating the documentation accordingly.
As a result of these efforts, the PoC was successfully industrialized and deployed, meeting the requirements of the project stakeholders and contributing to the overall success of the project.

`July 2019 - June 2021`
__Senior software developer__, AXA

_My first role in a large organization provided me with a valuable opportunity to contextualize and evaluate my skills within a corporate setting. Collaborating with talented developers, as well as individuals in management and insurance roles, expanded my perspective on the diverse aspects of the professional world._

_During this time, I gained exposure to the concept of LegalTech and was able to witness AXA's advancements in this area. This experience allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the intersection between the legal and technological fields and the potential impact it could have on the industry._

• The project required the development of a proof-of-concept (PoC) to put into practice the business logic proposed by the project with customers, while meeting network and reliability constraints.
My task was to develop the PoC, which involved designing and implementing the business logic in code, optimizing the code for network and reliability constraints, and ensuring that the PoC was functional and met the requirements of the project.
To achieve this, I conducted research and analysis to identify the optimal approach for designing and implementing the business logic, and implemented the code using best practices and efficient algorithms. I optimized the code for network and reliability constraints by conducting performance testing and implementing error handling mechanisms. I also worked closely with the project team to ensure that the PoC was functional and met the requirements of the project stakeholders.
The PoC was successfully developed and demonstrated to customers, validating the business logic proposed by the project and contributing to the overall success of the project. Additionally, the code was optimized for network and reliability constraints, resulting in improved performance and stability of the system.

- AWS S3 & Cloudfront

• Joined a new team with a technology stack that was different from my previous experience.
Needed to adapt my Angular knowledge to the Vue.js stack used by the project and become proficient in it.
Actively sought out opportunities to learn and familiarize myself with Vue.js, collaborated with colleagues to understand best practices, and worked hard to master the technology stack.
Successfully converted my Angular knowledge to Vue.js, contributed effectively to the project, and expanded my skillset. Became a go-to reference for Vue.js on the team, demonstrating value in investing in personal and professional development.
